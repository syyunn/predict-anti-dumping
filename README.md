# Predict Anti-dumping
This repo is to predict the antidumping measures orginiated from the U.S. Depoartment of Commerce and Int'l Trade Commission. The main reason of conducting this prediction is to check whether the information residing in the lobbying disclosure report (formally known as LD2) could acutally decrease the prediction error or not. Predicting Anti-dumping measures by soley relying on the LD2 might be insufficient, then, the research would change the direction to check whether the anti-dumping related lobbying could actually decrease the prediction error of related stock price movement or not.
