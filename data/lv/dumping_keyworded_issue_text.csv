a9fd08d1-9736-5012-b2e1-199c9152268b,2,MICHIGAN FARM BUREAU,Michigan Farm Bureau,"MFB urged Congress to support H.R. 101/S. 16 the Defending Domestic Produce Production Act, a bill that would make it easier for a small seasonal, specialty crop industry to build and take a case against a foreign county that is believed to be dumping product below the cost of production or unfairly subsidized by their government. We also urged support of S. 564, the Self Initiation Trade Enforcement Act, a bill that would create a task force within the Department of Commerce that small seasonal specialty crop industries could petition in the event they believe they are being hurt by unfair foreign competition.
Farm Bureau urged the Administration to quickly finalize a trade deal with the Peoples Republic of China and end tariffs hurting US agricultural exports. Farm Bureau urged quick passage, and end to tariffs and expanded markets for U.S. agriculture. Farm Bureau supported the Phase I agreement reached in January.
We also communicated to USDA about a concern with competition our tart cherry industry is experiencing from the country of Turkey with little barriers to entry, in addition to seasonal competition to US asparagus growers from Mexico and Peru. Michigan Farm Bureau advocated for and supported the new trade agreement with Japan. Japan currently is the top 3 trade destination for Michigan agricultural products.
Michigan Farm Bureau also advocated for improved trade with the European Union. Trade between the two countries amounts to $1 trillion worth of goods and services annually and $3.7 trillion in two-way direct investment. The U.S. exported $12.7 billion in agricultural products to the EU in 2018, while the EU exported $23.7 billion in agricultural products to the U.S. Specifically, MFB advocated for the following points: Include all agricultural products and policies in the negotiations; Eliminate non-tariff trade barriers; Ensure market access for biotechnology products; Address issues concerning import-sensitive products; Oppose the Precautionary Principle; and Oppose the use of geographic indicators.",2020-07-20 00:00:00

a89cf3d0-8bd9-5933-b1b3-6610e89e062d,2,MICHIGAN FARM BUREAU,Michigan Farm Bureau,"MFB urged Congress to support H.R. 101/S. 16 the Defending Domestic Produce Production Act, a bill that would make it easier for a small seasonal, specialty crop industry to build and take a case against a foreign county that is believed to be dumping product below the cost of production or unfairly subsidized by their government. We also urged support of S. 564, the Self Initiation Trade Enforcement Act, a bill that would create a task force within the Department of Commerce that small seasonal specialty crop industries could petition in the event they believe they are being hurt by unfair foreign competition.
Farm Bureau urged the Administration to quickly finalize a trade deal with the Peoples Republic of China and end tariffs hurting US agricultural exports. Farm Bureau urged quick passage, and end to tariffs and expanded markets for U.S. agriculture. Farm Bureau supported the Phase I agreement reached in January.
We also communicated to USDA about a concern with competition our tart cherry industry is experiencing from the country of Turkey with little barriers to entry, in addition to seasonal competition to US asparagus growers from Mexico and Peru. Michigan Farm Bureau advocated for and supported the new trade agreement with Japan. Japan currently is the top 3 trade destination for Michigan agricultural products.
Michigan Farm Bureau also advocated for improved trade with the European Union. Trade between the two countries amounts to $1 trillion worth of goods and services annually and $3.7 trillion in two-way direct investment. The U.S. exported $12.7 billion in agricultural products to the EU in 2018, while the EU exported $23.7 billion in agricultural products to the U.S. Specifically, MFB advocated for the following points: Include all agricultural products and policies in the negotiations; Eliminate non-tariff trade barriers; Ensure market access for biotechnology products; Address issues concerning import-sensitive products; Oppose the Precautionary Principle; and Oppose the use of geographic indicators.",2020-04-20 00:00:00

While we supported NAFTA, the USMCA is an opportunity to modernize or improve some areas for agriculture, we also support that - including Sanitary/Phytosanitary requirements, biotechnology, and additional protections for fruit and vegetable growers. MFB also has advocated the importance of the trading relationship with China to the Administration and Congress and the $20 billion positive impact to the ag sector in 2017. Farm Bureau advocated for passage of H.R. 5430, USMCA.
We also communicated to USDA about a concern with competition our tart cherry industry is experiencing from the country of Turkey with little barriers to entry, in addition to seasonal competition to US asparagus growers from Mexico and Peru. Michigan Farm Bureau advocated for and supported the new trade agreement with Japan. Japan currently is the top 3 trade destination for Michigan agricultural products.
MFB urged Congress to support H.R. 101/S. 16 the Defending Domestic Produce Production Act, a bill that would make it easier for a small seasonal, specialty crop industry to build and take a case against a foreign county that is believed to be dumping product below the cost of production or unfairly subsidized by their government. We also urged support of S. 564, the Self Initiation Trade Enforcement Act, a bill that would create a task force within the Department of Commerce that small seasonal specialty crop industries could petition in the event they believe they are being hurt by unfair foreign competition.
Farm Bureau urged the Administration to quickly finalize a trade deal with the Peoples Republic of China and end tariffs hurting US agricultural exports. Farm Bureau urged quick passage, and end to tariffs and expanded markets for U.S. agriculture.",2020-01-16 00:00:00
