### *What is Antidumping?*
U.S. industries may petition the government for relief from imports that are sold in the United States at less than fair value ("dumped").

Knetter and Prusa std drop in real GDP growth --> 23 percet increase in AD filings

### Current Loop Hole 
#### Level of Analysis
Only conducted in the aggregated level (total number of anti-dumping filing)
Better to be conducted in the product group level

#### Datasets 
##### Thomesen 2015 dataset
Includes all AD petitions filed in the U.S between Jan 1993 - Mar 2017
